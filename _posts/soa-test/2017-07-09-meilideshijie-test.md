- Beautiful New World
---

In the book's beautiful new world, people are not born of their parents, but they are nurtured. People do not care for the elderly, they have no bondage to marriage, they don’t even grow old. People are like children when they are 60 years old. Beautiful and youthful.

When people were a few years old, they began to receive education on their surnames. Adults would later associate with others without having a fixed lover.

The lab will give different children different sleep education so that they will fall in love with their post-adult status, and if people encounter unpleasant things in life, they can consume a drug called “rice”. After eating ramie, people will forget the troubles. Those who have rebelled against this kind of life will be put on an island.

When a woman fell in love with a man and had a child brought out of a beautiful new world, she would feel particularly painful for the next few decades. So why do people ask whether they like happiness or freedom?

Because when people are in happiness, they may say that I want a painful right, but when you really touch the pain, you will miss the beautiful new world.

I read super-extreme extremes and words almost from the group after watching “The Last Saviour” and “The Red Sky”, “Three-body”, “The Utopian”, “The Blade”, etc.; but after watching “The Beautiful World”, my mind is much better. In addition, I also learned and understood a lot of “different roles and social status, such as the roles and social status of the vegetables and the grocery shopping, and the differences in thinking and understanding of the burdens of understanding and understanding” are different. I feel that the author has not gone deep into the expression and description details. The translator's question (I haven't read the original), but it still helped me a lot and corrected my attitude. Personal humble opinion, do not like not to spray ha ha ha
