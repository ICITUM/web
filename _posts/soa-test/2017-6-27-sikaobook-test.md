- After dinner, I often have the habit of running. Keeping running allows me to feel energetic. It can not only maintain the spirit of concentration, but also help improve the body's ability to sense. I like to think while running, think of some simple questions, and summarize the experience of the day. When running, it's not suitable to think about complicated issues. High-frequency movements obviously interfere with your thoughts. I have noticed that once I enter complex calculations and think deeply, I will always slow down or stop motionless, and jogging or walking will not have a significant impact on thinking.
Why do you slow down unconsciously when thinking deeply?
 

- This is explained in the book: The simple question corresponds to System 1, and deep thinking requires the help of System 2. Running along the road not only requires physical exertion, but also requires self-control of the brain to prevent it from decelerating. Self-control and careful thinking clearly entailed a limited budget for efforts, further affecting the brain's ability to calculate and summarize, so we would stop consciously.
The problems with System 1 and System 2 mentioned in the book are very interesting. I understand it as intuition and reason. Of course, this kind of generalization is not comprehensive. Therefore, we still use the system 1 and system 2 mentioned by the author here:

- The operation of System 1 is unconscious and quick, and it does not take much effort, no feeling, and is completely in autonomous control.
- System 2 shifts its attention to brain-intensive brain activities such as complex calculations. The operation of system 2 is usually associated with subjective experiences such as behavior, choice and concentration.

- The rational use of System 1 and System 2 is very important. Sometimes there is no need for willpower. People can also spend a lot of time and energy on a job.
Since the beginning of fitness, several companions have initially gone every day, but they have been sore for a few days and never go. On the contrary, I practiced the next day, and I became accustomed to being accustomed. In the past few months, I lost not only 10 pounds, but also my muscles. My mental state has also been very good.

- There is a saying in the Peasant Quotations: People who are too hard to run are not far away, and it is not the passion that really insists on the last person, but the right kindness and input.

- This condition is also mentioned in the book, which was named by Mikhali, a psychologist. Those who have experienced the flow describe it as "a state that concentrates the brain effortlessly. This state can make people forget the concept of time, forget about themselves, and forget about their own problems."

- Too much effort can easily lead to self-injury. The psychological test results described in the book have repeatedly proved that it is hard to control the will and control oneself. If you force yourself too much to do something and the pressures are unbearable, you will become more and more difficult to control yourself. This phenomenon is named self loss. Just as you have been mourning "Do not think about the polar bear" in your heart, you will make yourself think of polar bears. Self-suppression is not a long-term solution, and letting nature take its course is a reasonable approach.

- This book brings me a lot of thought. So, this book review, I would like to put last.

- I often think that if this book is changed to a more interesting name, there should be more readers. Tossing out this boring headline is actually a very interesting book. It has a novel point of view, a picture and text, both professional and interesting. The book mixes the knowledge of economics and psychology and it is very attractive. For me, it is just as enjoyable as reading the novel. Of course, the more professional the content of the book is, the more difficult it is to understand, and the lack of strong intention can be skipped.
