This is the purpose of the author's writing on Walden. He hopes that each person will display his own face and his actions, find their uniqueness and value orientation, and the thousands of worlds must have different looks and different flavors. People are. More should be.
 
  When we see different viewpoints, customs, people, things, and things from ourselves, we do not refute exclusion, not sarcastic sarcasm, but we try to see as much as possible the rationality and necessity of things that are different from you. This is human affairs. Mature. This book really read more and more interesting.
 
“Loneliness is a required course of life” is a splicing of a period of independence in the course of life's needs. It reminds me of a sentence: “There is no person who cries late at night, not enough to talk about life.” A person is experiencing late-night crying After the search from the inner self, after experiencing the pain from the outside world after the attack, after experiencing how much time in the heart of the loss and embarrassment, it is possible to find their own hearts. Thoreau in Walden
 
Many times, I don’t even want to disturb my time alone. I’m not an isolated person. I like to read books on my own, let alone my thoughts flutter, write some disorganized words alone, and enjoy the sunshine under the window of the afternoon alone.

 Boring, loneliness and loneliness are three different moods.
  
Boring is the desire to dissipate oneself among others. It seeks amusement.
 
Loneliness is the desire for oneself to coexist with others. It seeks ordinary human warmth.
 Loneliness is the desire to take others into self. It seeks understanding.
 
 Those who are bored are self-indulgent, those who are lonely are self-pity, and those who are lonely are self-sufficient. Boring is comical, loneliness is tragic, and loneliness is neutral. Boring is a biological person, loneliness belongs to a social person, and loneliness belongs to a metaphysical person.
 
 It feels quite reasonable, especially if the loners are self-sufficient. In many cases, loneliness is focused and relaxed, but it is a proper enjoyment.
The loggers have the poet's simplicity and the philosopher's shadow. They are members of nature and belong to the society. In contrast to the secular world, he instead respected himself and was somewhat detached, but he did not know it but only lived his own life.
 
He said that the tree had been happily died here, and there was no better fun than this. The desire is single and pure.
From this point of view, life is going to find its own pleasure, and simply doing it with persistence will make it easier to experience happiness.
Hamlet is a lot, but it's fun, isn't it?
