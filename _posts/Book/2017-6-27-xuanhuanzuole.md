#### Background source

"Let Fun" is not specifically designed to describe two characters, Edward Derryfield and Alroy Kiir. When I was young, I had a close relationship with the young woman in the book that I called Rossi. She has major, irritating mistakes, but she looks beautiful and people are honest. My relationship with her ended like this as it always did, but my memories of her continued to haunt my mind year after year. I know that one day I will write her into a novel...

#### Brief Description

  (Cakes and ale):

In the third line of Toby's line from Shakespeare's "Twelve Nights" in Act II, "Do you think that you are morally lofty and that people cannot be happy?"

#### After reading

The book “Let's Fun” reveals the bizarre and ridiculous phenomenon of the British literary world at the time through the depiction of the “literary writer” Driffield and the various characters around him. Readers can look at Maugham's writer Derry Fielder from the humble to prominent life and the image of city clerk Alroy Kiir seeing the world’s insolence and the hypocrisy of some literati and savvy, sleek, but Maug more interested in portraying The actress Rossi Rossi is a complex woman. She was originally a hotel waitress. She never concealed her low birth, her mannerless manners, and her hypocrisy. The second wife of Driffield was in stark contrast to the flow of Mrs. Barton Trafford. She is innocent and good-natured. Although she misbehaves in the lives of men and women, she is by no means an extravagance. “She is a good woman. I never saw her tantrum. You want her to give you something, just open your mouth. I never heard her say something unfriendly to others, her heart Very kind." "She is a very honest woman. Her nature is healthy and candid. She is willing to make others happy. In the chapter before the end of the story, what Ah Shenden said when he talked Rossi about the second wife of Alroy Kiir and Driffield, Rossi, could actually be seen. It is the author's generalization of Rossi’s character that the author gradually enriched her image by depicting her three periods in the dark horse town, London, and finally in the town of Yonkers near New York, thus becoming the largest of all Maugham’s novels. Vivid, vivid and glorious female figure.
 
#### Social evaluation

“Laughing in Fun” is also Maum’s most complete and perfect work of art. The layout of the entire novel is patchwork, and the actual introduction and past memories are interspersed with each other. The narrative clues are constantly reciprocating and clear, and they are in seemingly sloppy structure. There are clever arrangements, colloquial narratives are concise and smooth, and the text is neat and tidy. During this period, the author was eager to comment on the status of the literary world at that time, and there was no lack of taunting and sarcasm during the chattering in the parlors that mimicked the aftermath of tea. But still contains the understanding and sympathy of people, no wonder that the modern British literary critic AC Wald thinks that "Let Fun" is Maugham's best novel [190], and the contemporary British female writer and literary critic Marc Ritter Drabble also regards "Let Fun" as Maum's most talented work
 
##### Quotes

- Do you think that you are morally lofty and that others cannot be happy?

The two main characters in the book, one is Drewfield, the author, and the other is his first wife, Rossi.
 
- I mainly want to talk about his wife Rossi:
 
When the author of the book first met a couple of writers, they described their lives in detail: They rode together, entertained guests, and ran away.
 
Rossi is with many men, but the strange thing is that this woman does not hate. I believe we have encountered many such women in literary works. They do not seem to be special in love, and their behavior is also very casual. You know in your heart that such a person is not very good in love and morality, but she is not annoying to see her in her works, such as Cao Xueqin's You Youjie.
 
Although the personality is very different from your special elder sister, this woman does not hate either. The reason I think I don't hate them may be that their life is colorful. Or because of their cute character, I am not depressed in life. Even in real life, I believe they will be good friends. Jin Yong's Cheng Lingsu was very popular, but Jin Yong’s death was not just for her. She highlighted the cuteness and sincerity of her character. She always spits out her tongue and winks her eyes. This is also her lovely place.
 
It seems a bit off topic.
 
After returning to Rossi, she was a happy person. He didn't care too much about it or not. Even though she was old and old, she was still clever at work. All the disadvantages of the elderly were not. In a word, she is always a young man.
 
She does not conceal her humble working experience, is very forthright, and is sincere to others. She is unrestrained, of course, because of this personality, so that she seems a little debauchery to many people.
 
The writer is very happy when she is with her. He can sing funny songs and do crazy things. Waiting for their lives can be described as having fun together. This point of fugitive debt is the most interesting. They pretend to be very rich. They owe it everywhere. Then one day they suddenly run away. They have a mischievous interest in doing these things. They also write that they are kind, although the life is a little noisy. , but they still owe the poor. Later Rossi elopement, but also to the mother to play money, it is evident that this girl is very kind.
 
Rossi ran away afterwards. The writer got married to a more vain woman. His life should be considered boring. He writes something every day, and he has to live meticulously for the sake of other people. Although he was famous, But often go to the bar to drink stuffy.
 
So this is a kind of thinking that Maugham gave to us, whether it should be a matter of minutes to see the end of life, or to listen to their own hearts, to love the person who really loves, and to do what they really want to do.
 
In fact, when there is really no scruples in the heart, happiness will be more. Most of the boredom in life comes from feeling that they cannot meet the expectations of others, whether it be parents, loved ones or friends.
 
When people live, they must listen to their own hearts. It is easy to say and it is difficult to do.

> I have no idea which writer in the history of literature has committed suicide while he is writing a literary work. No matter what tribulation he encountered, he was unwilling to leave behind an unfinished work for future generations.
 
> I looked at her face; I didn't think I fell in love with her. I just like to sit quietly beside her and look at her pale golden hair and pale golden skin.
 
> A person who hears another person's assertion that he is a genius will always be very happy.
 
> She was extremely sophisticated and sensitive when she abandoned him. Even Jasper Gibbons himself might not know that he had been abandoned. However, there is no doubt about this. She would not say anything against him. In fact, she wouldn’t want to talk about him again. When others mentioned him, she only smiled slightly and sent a sigh of relief. But her smile was coup de grace[129] and her sigh buried him deeply.
 
> I don’t know what amazing strategies she has adopted, what magical wrists she has shown, what kind of caring care and exquisite sympathy she has shown, and what she describes as elegant and nice words; I can only guess from the side and say admiration.
 
> They likened him to Milton (because of his poetry's tone), to Keats (because of his rich aesthetic image), compared to Shelley (because of his empty and imaginary imagination)
 
> The most discriminating critics praised his works. Friends from his family all agreed that one day he will receive attention. They blame the public that they do not see a great writer here; since the easiest way to celebrate a man is to demean another person, they arbitrarily vilify all those writers whose reputation was greater than that of Derry Field.
 
> I remembered all the hopes of all the people living here, their bright future, and the fiery passion of youth; some people must feel regret, disillusionment, physical and mental exhaustion, helplessness; how many people How much of life's joys and sorrows are tasted here, which actually contains the entire range of human emotions, so this room itself also seems strangely with a disturbing and elusive personality.
 
> Praising a person you are not afraid of is often a good way to hinder the success of your real competitors.
 
> Beauty is a dead end. It is like a mountain. Once it reaches the top of the mountain, it will find nowhere to go.
