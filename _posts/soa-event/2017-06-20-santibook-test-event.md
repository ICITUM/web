#### After reading the three bodies, there are still some things
 
  Especially on such a rainy night, as if it were light rain, my thoughts were lingering.


The three-body novel describes the whole universe in a macroscopic way and microscopically talks about the proton quark, and the human nature. On the scale of the universe, the history of humankind can not be traced, and the development of human civilization is also minimal. Where can humans go?
 
 
Once again, I was saddened by people's understanding of the dedication of saving humanity. I was touched again and again, and I was moved forward again! The feeling of pure love. Human beings are very small, like ants. In the sea of stars, human civilization is not even a small boat. However, because of the tenacity of life, the spirit of hard work for survival, it makes humans so great. There are also many concepts in human nature that are not united with survival struggle, such as the psychological description of Cheng Xin who runs through the third main line.


 
In the beginning, under the control of the man, I also hated and resented Cheng Xin, but at the last moment, suddenly I was relieved. Maybe in human nature there is such hesitation. This kind of contradiction, this kind of softness, makes it The human world is more real and warmer. At the end of the three bodies, the human world has left behind a small fish, a pudgy water, and several green grasslands. This is the last appearance of the earth. Following Cheng Xin's three rides on a boat to the huddled universe, perhaps this is the end of the universe's life. Or not. Let me come to the end of the first Terminator movie. The yellow tape that keeps falling under the headlights seems to have ended, and it seems to be endless.


 Perhaps billions of years later, there are tribal civilizations and the legacy of the earth civilization. Looking back at this book now, it is like an infinitely unrolling scroll full of surprises, sighs and sorrows.
 
  
  I am a person outside of the painting, but I am moved to tears because of the people in the painting. I still like the beginning. I like Ye Wenjie's struggle against human nature. I like Yang Dong’s early detection. I like Ding Yi’s final calm and calmness. The firmness and enthusiasm in Germany's eyes, like Luo Ji's life full of magic, like AA and Tianming happy life, like Captain Yan Yan's decisive ... but I still can not forgive my heart.

#### The best love story of the three bodies:
 

> Our planet outside the earth
Time outside our universe
The best love and confession in this world is more than this...


Give time to life, not to life

Really feel that Liu Cixin is not only an engineering student: criminal psychology, psychology, sociology, and social engineering are all permeated in one chapter and one word (intentionally using one chapter and one phrase because most contemporary novels will The chapters and content deliberately copied the hard-hitting stuff of related professional knowledge.)

The first time to read is curious
The second time is awe

How fortunate. It takes only a few hours and up to tens of hours to complete the writer's brainchild. Feel their thoughts or thoughts, or joys and sorrows, and learn nutrients and strength from words.
Popular science is realistic and utilitarian. Science fiction is emotional and idealistic. Popular science is the inculcation of knowledge. Science fiction is the inspiration of the soul. No matter how many years of civilization and how much nationalism does not have no scientific nourishment, it is only just “Uniform”.
